# Static site generator

This is a really simple static site generator. It takes markdown files from the
posts directory and makes pages for each based on frontmatter. The resulting
site has a homepage with links to each post in reverse chronological order.

For an example, see my blog [here][blog]. To read the blog post about how I
wrote this, see [here][post].
